# Promises

This code is adapted from [JavaScript Promises for Dummies](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies) by Jecelyn Yeen.

Copy the html and javascript files to your web server.  Then play around with the code to make sure you understand what is going on.  Each of the four buttons runs a Promise and then outputs the result. Please see the code for documentation.
